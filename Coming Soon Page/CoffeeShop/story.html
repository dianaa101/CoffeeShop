            At Interlude Coffee, we believe that a great cup of coffee is more than just a drink...
            it's a moment of pause, a comforting ritual, and a bridge between people. Our journey began with a simple idea:
            to create a space where the community can come together, savor exceptional coffee, and take a break from the rush of daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Founded by passionate coffee lovers, Interlude Coffee started as a small dream in a bustling city.
            We wanted to craft an experience that goes beyond just serving coffee. From sourcing the finest beans from
            sustainable farms around the world to meticulously roasting them in-house, every step is taken with care and precision.
        </p>

        <p>
            But our story isn’t just about coffee; it’s about the people who make it, the customers who enjoy it,
            and the connections forged over a shared love of this timeless beverage. Whether you’re grabbing a quick
            espresso on your way to work, catching up with friends over a latte, or finding a quiet corner to reflect,
            Interlude Coffee is here to make those moments special.
