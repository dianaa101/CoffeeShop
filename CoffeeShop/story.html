                At Interlude Coffee, we believe that a great cup of coffee is more than just a drink... 
                it's a moment of pause, a comforting ritual, and a bridge between people. Our journey began with a simple idea: 
                to create a space where the community can come together, savor exceptional coffee, and take a break from the rush of daily life.
            </p>

                Founded by passionate coffee lovers, Interlude Coffee started as a small dream in a bustling city. 
                We wanted to craft an experience that goes beyond just serving coffee. From sourcing the finest beans from 
                sustainable farms around the world to meticulously roasting them in-house, every step is taken with care and precision.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But our story isn’t just about coffee; it’s about the people who make it, the customers who enjoy it, 
                and the connections forged over a shared love of this timeless beverage. Whether you’re grabbing a quick 
                espresso on your way to work, catching up with friends over a latte, or finding a quiet corner to reflect, 
                Interlude Coffee is here to make those moments special.
